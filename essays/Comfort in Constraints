HTML and CSS are incredibly barebones. They are powerful but if you try to use these on their own to build something real, but due to this "barebone-ness" they tend to feel indifferent. They don't care that you're trying to build a cohesive looking webpage that has buttons that belong to the same product, or whether your layout collapses gracefully on a phone. For a small page, it might feel refreshing to have such a barebone level of control over everything. But for anything larger than a couple pages, I could only imagine how incredibly cluttered a CSS file might get.

This is where a UI framework like Bootstrap 5 starts to make a lot of sense. It's not that it magically makes HTML and CSS easier. (I actually thought it was a little intimidating upon making the switch to Bootstrap.) But it does make decisions easier. You don't need to decide how big or small individual elements need to be because you are working essentially on a grid with predictable behavior. You do trade some creative freedom but what you get back is a shared convention, styles that don't break when used incorrectly, and resuable components. Not to mention easily creating cohesive webpages that look and feel fluid, which at the end of the day is all you really need.
