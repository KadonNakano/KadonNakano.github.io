Since 2024, I have been working at an fine dining restaurant called "MW". For my first year at this restaurant, I worked as a busser. Contrary to what you might be thinking, working as a busser at this restaurant is no small job. This job demands a mental and physical intensity that I have not experienced anywhere else in my life. You are constantly moving and constantly thinking, you want to be as efficient as possible. You are working with seconds so its important to eliminate everything unnecessary. And you must do this all while maintaining grace and customer service.

Recently, I've been promoted to expo/runner and I'm very proud of this achievement. Im moving around a lot less but that phsical work has been replaced by more mental work. I'm still learning the ropes but I've already learned a lot about delegation as well as time management and organizational skills.
