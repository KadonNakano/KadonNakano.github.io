Since 2024, I’ve worked at MW, a fine-dining restaurant. During my first year, I was a busser. While that role is often underestimated, at MW it’s anything but small. The job demands constant movement and constant focus—you’re always anticipating what’s needed next, working in seconds, and finding ways to eliminate anything unnecessary so service stays smooth. All of that has to happen while maintaining professionalism, grace, and genuine hospitality.

Recently, I was promoted to expo/runner, and I’m proud of that achievement. I’m moving less than I did as a busser, but the physical intensity has been replaced by a higher level of mental responsibility. I’m now coordinating timing, communicating clearly between the kitchen and the floor, and helping keep the pace of service consistent. I’m still learning the ropes, but I’ve already developed stronger communication and delegation skills, along with sharper time management and organization.
