When I think about the things that got me into computer engineering, I always go back to my childhood. I started playing video games on a console called the PS2 on a CRT television when I was very young. I fell in love with the feeling of having “skill” in a game, and more than that, the learning process it took to build it: failing, trying again, noticing what worked, and slowly getting better. Later on, I fell in love with the iPhone and it's UX. Even later, I got into PCs and learned that I really enjoyed tinkering, building, and testing them.

Looking back, that same “get better” mindset never really left, it just moved from games into technology. The kid who wanted to master "Ratchet and Clank" is the same person who now enjoys learning new tools, breaking things, fixing them, and improving through repetition. Over time, getting good at learning became its own skill for me, and that’s a big reason I want a career in tech. For the longest time, my dream was (and still sort of is) to be in game development, because I’d love to be part of the team that gives the next generation the same spark I felt back then.

Though as I got older, I think I became more practical, and I started paying attention to what makes technology feel good to use. While working through my computer engineering degree, I realized I’m not only interested in how things work, but also how they’re experienced by the person using them. I constantly get the urge to make my programs as user-friendly as possible, even when I know I’m the only one who’s going to use them. To me, the details matter and small choices make something feel smooth instead of frustrating.

If there’s one skill I want to focus on learning next, it’s UX design, because it’s where my interest in building things and my attention to how they feel come together. And in a perfect world, I’d use that in software or game development, creating experiences that are functional and genuinely enjoyable.
