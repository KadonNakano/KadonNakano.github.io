Since 2024, I have been working at an fine dining restaurant called "MW". For my first year at this restaurant, I worked as a busser. Contrary to what you might be thinking, working as a busser at this restaurant is no small job. Many of these shifts have been some of the most physically AND mentally demanding things I've ever experienced. You are constantly moving and thinking at the same time, so you want to be as efficient as possible. You are working with seconds so you want to eliminate as much unnecessary movement as possible. And you are doing this all while maintaining grace and customer service skills.

Recently, I have been promoted to runner and I'm very proud of this achievement. A runner's job is much more mentally intensive
