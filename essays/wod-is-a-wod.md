This week, we did two WODs: one practice and one real. I finished the practice WOD just in the nick of time but was not able to finish the real WOD. I think that I'm still learning how to best approach these challenges. While AI usage is allowed, my conscience is telling me to use it as little as possible to facilitate more learning. 

I think I've realized that these WODs are testing more than just our TypeScript knowledge. They're also testing how effectively we can use AI as a tool without letting it do the thinking for us. I think that’s a smart, healthy way to bring AI into the classroom, because it encourages responsible use. With how quickly AI is taking over everything, I feel like this is what modern teaching should look like.
